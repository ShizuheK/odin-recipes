    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple dessert, quick to make and very tasty</p>
    <p>Instructions and images from BBC Good Food</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g jar good-quality lemon curd</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>300ml pot whipping or double cream</li>
        <li>25g cruchy lemon flavoured biscuits (optional toppings)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put two-thirds of the lemon curd into a large bowl with the zest and cream, then beat with an electric whisk until it just holds its shape. 
            Dribble over the rest of the lemon curd and divide between 6 small glass pots or glasses, marbling the curd through as you go. Sit the pots 
            on a small tray, cover the whole lot with cling film and freeze for 30-40 minutes.</li>
        <li>(Optional toppings) Put the biscuits in a strong plastic bag and bash with the end of a rolling pin to crumbs. When you're ready for pudding, 
            remove the pots from the freezer (they should be ice cold but still soft and creamy), top with crumbs and serve.</li>
    </ol>
